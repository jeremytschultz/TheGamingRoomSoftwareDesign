# TheGamingRoomSoftwareDesign
Completed software design document with project requirements and proposed solution.
1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room, a company that made a game called Draw It or Lose It. It was originally made for Android, but they wanted to expand it so it could run on other platforms too. They needed software that could support multiple operating systems, handle multiple players at once, and keep everything secure and consistent across devices.
2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did a good job explaining the different system options and comparing their pros and cons. I made sure my recommendations were clear and easy to understand, especially when it came to which platforms and technologies would be the best fit for their game.
3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document helped me organize my thoughts before writing any code. It made it easier to plan how different parts of the system would connect and what technologies to use. Having everything mapped out first saved time and helped me catch potential problems early.
4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could change one part, I’d probably go back and add more details to the security section. I mentioned a few good points, but I think I could have explained better how user data would be protected across different platforms.
5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I looked at what the client wanted most. Things like multi-platform access, good performance, and a smooth user experience. I designed the system to meet those goals by focusing on scalability and cross-platform compatibility. It’s important to think about user needs because if the software doesn’t work the way they expect or need it to, it really doesn’t matter how well it’s built.
6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I started by breaking down the main requirements and then comparing different system architectures to see which one made the most sense. I also thought about cost, security, and performance. In the future, I’d use the same approach but spend more time on testing and user feedback early in the process. That way, I can catch issues before the final build.
